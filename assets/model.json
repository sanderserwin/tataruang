Some parts of the room were not being replaced by new materials because of the budget, this was a challenge for us to make some parts of the room to be synchronized with the new materials. We mixed the white and gold colors with existing wood materials. We used grc board with white painted wood stain at the wall with carving gypsum to give semi classic design. At the windows we add carving gypsum to make it more semi classic feels and to make it more beautiful with the grc wood stain on the wall. The concept is to make it elegant with the gold and white taste mixed it with teak wood materials in existing. We add some furniture to provide the client needs for facial treatment like a mirror and some space to put some stuffs. We use gold texture in the mirror and white texture at the bracket to blend it with the white wood stain wall. The final result of this beautybar.jkt is a little bit different because of the budget itself, but we keep the concept and control it until it’s done and we still use the main concept for the design. We use the grc white wood stain only half to press the budget and change the bracket into a small cabinet to make it affordable.",
